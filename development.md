# FastAPI Project - Development

## Local Development

Use an approved isolated copy of the canonical product PostgreSQL baseline, with
its existing tenants, identity crosswalk and WorkOS projections. An empty local
template database is not an authentication authority. Configure the explicit
runtime/WorkOS variables listed in [backend/README.md](backend/README.md), using
`FASTAPI_ENV=development` and the exact local browser origin registered with the
selected nonproduction WorkOS application.

From the upstream root, sync its independent native solve:

```bash
uv sync --locked --package app
```

An embedding workspace must select its declared external API environment instead
of modifying the parent's Python environment. Migration generation/application
requires separate reviewed authority; it is not an automatic development seed.

Start FastAPI from `backend/` after provisioning the approved baseline:

```bash
uv run fastapi dev
```

In another terminal, from the project root, install the frontend dependencies and start the Vite development server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Now you can open these URLs:

Frontend development server: <http://localhost:5173>

Backend API: <http://localhost:8000>

Automatic interactive API documentation with Swagger UI: <http://localhost:8000/docs>


The frontend development server uses the backend at `http://localhost:8000`, as configured in `frontend/.env`.

### Frontend Served by FastAPI

Build the frontend from the `frontend` directory:

```bash
bun run build
```

The build is written to `backend/app/frontend` and served by FastAPI at <http://localhost:8000>. Rebuild the frontend after making frontend changes.

## Full Stack with Docker Compose

To run the backend and built frontend in Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm migrate
docker compose watch
```

Now you can open these URLs:

Application, with the frontend and API served by FastAPI: <http://localhost:8000>

Automatic interactive API documentation with Swagger UI: <http://localhost:8000/docs>


Traefik UI, to see how the routes are being handled by the proxy: <http://localhost:8090>

Mailpit: <http://localhost:8025>

Stop a locally running FastAPI server before starting the Compose backend because both use port `8000`.

**Note**: The first time you start the stack, it might take a minute for all the services to be ready. To monitor it, use `docker compose logs`, or `docker compose logs backend` for the backend service.

## Mailpit

[Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org) captures emails sent during local development instead of delivering them. The local backend connects to it at `localhost:1025`, and the Compose backend connects to the `mailpit` service. Captured emails are available at <http://localhost:8025>.

## Docker Compose Files and Environment Variables

The main `compose.yml` file contains the configuration shared by the whole stack. Docker Compose loads it automatically.

The `compose.override.yml` file adds local development settings, such as mounting the source code as a volume. Docker Compose also loads it automatically and applies it on top of `compose.yml`.

The `compose.deploy.yml` file contains the deployment-specific settings, including HTTPS and automatic certificate handling. It is explicitly combined with `compose.yml` when deploying the application.

The backend reads local settings from the `.env` file. Docker Compose also uses it for variable interpolation and passes the settings each container needs.

After changing variables, make sure you restart the stack:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

## The `.env` File

Local environment files may supply explicitly selected nonproduction settings.
The backend/Compose now require `DATABASE_URL` and `WORKOS_*`; legacy template
passwords are not usable credentials. Compose does not start a replacement
product database. Never commit database URLs, provider keys or production
secrets. Supply the migration URL only to the maintenance migration service.

Do not store deployment secrets in `.env`. Configure them as described in the [FastAPI Cloud deployment guide](./deployment.md) or the [Docker Compose deployment guide](./deployment-docker-compose.md).

## Pre-commit Hooks and Code Linting

The project uses [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/), a modern alternative to [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), for code linting and formatting.

You can find a file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with configurations at the root of the project.

### Install `prek` to Run Automatically

`prek` is already part of the dependencies of the project.

From the project root, install the Git hook so that `prek` runs automatically before each commit:

```bash
uv run prek install -f
```

The `-f` flag forces the installation, in case there was already a `pre-commit` hook previously installed.

Now whenever you try to commit, for example with:

```bash
git commit
```

`prek` will check and format the code you are about to commit. If it modifies any files, add those files to Git again before committing.

### Run `prek` Manually

You can also run `prek` manually on all files from the project root:

```bash
uv run prek run --all-files
```
